**Email/SMS Spam Classifier**

This project is an Email and SMS Spam Classifier built using Python, Streamlit, and machine learning techniques. The classifier leverages a TfidfVectorizer to transform text data into numerical features, which are then used to train a MultinomialNB (Naive Bayes) model. The app allows users to input a message and predicts whether it is "Spam" or "Not Spam". The project demonstrates text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model deployment in a user-friendly web interface.

**Features:**

1)Text Preprocessing: Includes tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.

2)Machine Learning Model: Trained using a Naive Bayes classifier.

3)Web Interface: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction and deployment.

How to Run:

(i)Clone the repository.

(ii)Install the required packages.

(iii)Run the Streamlit app to start classifying messages.
